# 🎯 ThirdEye: Onchain Shooter

**ThirdEye** is a fully on-chain, third-person inspired shooter game built with pure Solidity.  
Players control warrior avatars on a 10x10 grid, move strategically, and shoot opponents.  
All logic — movement, shooting, eliminations — is stored and executed 100% on the blockchain.
